# AirBnB Clone - The Console

---

## Description

This project is the first step towards building a full web application of the AirBnB clone. In this first step we are building a console, a custom command interpreter that will be used in subsequent AirBnB projects to manage objects of our classes.

This console will allow us to do the following:

* Create a new object
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object

## Usage

* The console can be run in both interactive and non-interactive mode.
* It prints a prompt **(hbnb)** and waits for the user for input.

### Interactive Mode

```cmd
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
```

### Non-Interactive Mode

```cmd
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
```
